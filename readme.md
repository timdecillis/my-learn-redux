# Learn Redux Stater files

This repo includes the `learn-redux` folder which is where you will build your application as well as a number of partially finished `client` folder contents that correspond with the **start** of each video. These stepped folders should be used to reference or restore your application if things aren't working 100%.

There are only folders for videos which have significant changes.

## Getting Started

Fork or download this repo and run `npm install` in the folder with the `package.json` file.


## Pull Requests 

Pull requests that fix dependencies between the videos and this repo are welcome as long as they correspond with the code written in the videos.


## FAQ / Help

**Before anything**, make sure you are on the latest node. You can run `npm -v` and if you have anything less than `5.x`, you'll need to update. The files will probably work on older versions, but in my experience 80% of issues go away with an update.

I'll use this space to add FAQ as they come in.
